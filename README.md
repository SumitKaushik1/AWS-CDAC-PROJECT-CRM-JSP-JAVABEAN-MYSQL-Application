CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. It refers to a strategy, process, or technology used by businesses to manage interactions and relationships with current and potential customers.

The primary goal of CRM is to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention by understanding and meeting the needs of individual customers. CRM systems typically collect and organize customer data from various touchpoints such as sales, marketing, customer service, and social media interactions. This data can include contact information, purchase history, preferences, and feedback.

CRM software enables businesses to track customer interactions, manage leads and opportunities, automate marketing campaigns, and provide better customer service. By analyzing customer data, businesses can identify trends, anticipate needs, and personalize their communication and offerings to better serve their customers.

Overall, CRM helps businesses build stronger, more profitable relationships with their customers and drive growth and success.
